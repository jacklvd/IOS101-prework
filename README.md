   - All-in-one workspace (notes, tasks, databases)
   - Real-time collaboration and inline commenting

   - Daily streaks to encourage consistency

5. **Discord**

### App Idea

An app idea I would like to build is **StudyFlow** â€“ a student productivity platform that helps manage study sessions, assignments, and collaborative workspaces. The app would feature:

- **Timed focus sessions** using the Pomodoro technique
- **Shared to-do lists and project boards** for group study or assignments
- **Real-time group voice chat** integrated with task tracking
- **Study analytics** to track your focus time and productivity trends

This app aims to improve study efficiency and make collaborative work more structured and enjoyable.
